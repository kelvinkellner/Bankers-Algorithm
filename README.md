# Description

Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance method that simulates allocation for predefined maximum feasible quantities of all resources in order to test for safety.

# Installation

--> C Programming Language<br/>
--> GCC Complier for C<br/>
--> Windows Subsystem for Linux<br/>

Compile the program using GCC. When running, pass a list of space-delimited integers as arguments.
The value of the number represents the number of available resources of that type of resource.
Edit sample4_in.txt to change the customers. Each line in the file represents a thread,
and the comma-delimited values represent the amount of each type of resource that the thread needs.

# Features / Commands

- Request resources:<br/>
  Requests an allocation of resources to a thread/customer, succeeds if resources are currently available and system remains safe after processing request, fails otherwise.<br/>

  <img src="./img/ss_3.png" alt="screenshot of request for resources failing" /><br/>
  <br/>
- Release resources:<br/>
  Releases resources currently being used by a thread/customer and makes them available again, fails if thread has not been allocated those resources.<br/>

  <br/>
- Status:<br/>
  Displays the status of the system including available resources, and maximum, allocated, and needed resources for each thread/customer.<br/>

  <br/>
- Run:<br/>
  Determines if there is a safe sequence for the threads/customers and executes the sequence if possible.<br/>
